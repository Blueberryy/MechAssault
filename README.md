# MechAssault

Drivable mechs for Garry's Mod

Aimed at bringing a fairly close approximation of the mechs (And maybe other vehicles in the future) from [MechAssault 2: Lone Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MechAssault_2:_Lone_Wolf) into Garry's Mod.

While still a work-in-progress, most of the base features are implemented and the addon is usable in both single and multiplayer out of the box.
